    <h1>Seven Habits of Highly Effective Software Developers</h1>
    <h3>By Bruce M. Van Horn II</h3>
    <p>There's a famous book known by many in my generation, but that maybe the younger set hasn't yet heard of.
        It's titled <em>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em> by Steven Covey.  It's such an influential book
        that it has shaped the way a great many people live their lives.  Lately, I've been trying to think of how I
    could tailor some of the motivational and general business knowledge programs, such the quality training I underwent
    at EDS back in the early 1990's, to a specific group of people.  These bodies of knowledge and wisdom are useful
    but very general, so I thought I'd try to adapt those messages to specific practice in my field of software development
    and engineering.</p>
    <p>I'm not going to outline Covey's habits and adapt them, but instead, I'll enumerate the seven traits, which in my
    experience, set's apart highly effective software engineers from the more common set.  Over the years I've worked
    with all kinds of developers from the super-heroic and "Wow, I'll never be a smart as that guy." to the mundane
    clock punching types who come in and do the bare minimum to avoid getting fired, to the truly incompetent.  If I were
    to rate and plot these people, it'd be a bell curve.  The top and bottom outliers, the supers and the inept are
    rarities, sometimes to the point of being unicorns.  I can think of fewer than five in either camp in the 30 years I've
    been working.  The truth is, most of us, myself included, are somewhere in the middle of the curve.</p>
    <h4>If you've made it this far in the article, you're likely already exhibiting some of these traits.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Curiosity</li>
        <li>Mental Agility</li>
        <li>Grit</li>
        <li>Sticktuitiveness</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Curiosity</h3>
    <p>Great software developers are always learning.  Sure some of that is driven, especially early in your career out
    of a sense of self preservation.  But it's the developers who are driven by curiosity that I've seen rise in the ranks
    in terms of achievement and in terms of gaining the respect of their peers.</p>
	<p>To test this premise, I went to the bookstore and bought a bunch of magazines on a number of different topics related
	to the work my team was doing at the time.  Before you scoff at my reference to analog media, I'll point out that yes,
	we had the Internet at the time.  It was 2005.  We even had iPhones back then.  But it was still a time when people read
	works printed on paper at least as often, if not more so than on screens.</p>
	<p>At the time I was the Director of Content Services for a publishing company.  I lead what I'd consider to be a very
	effective team with a gamut of skills which included artists, designers, coders, videographers, and editors.  The magazines
	I picked up were on things like Photoshop, Visual Studio, C# programming, web development, modern design, 3D graphics, and general
	business.  I placed these magazines in the team room on a table that was in the center of the room.  Everyone's cubes were arranged around
	the table, so everyone could see the stack of materials on the table.</p>
	<p>Then, I waited a week.</p>
	<p>After a week had passed, the stack of magazines was gone!  My plan was working perfectly.  I waited until everyone went home for the day and
	I went on a scouting missing to find the magazines.  It took a while to find them all, but I did, and took note of which magazines were on whose
	desks.</p>
	<h4>That's when I discovered something interesting.  They were almost all on the desks of people I considered solid contributors, but there was something unexpected.</h4>
	<p>The programmers hadn't uniformly picked up the programming magazines.  When they did, they just flipped through it and put it back down.  They were taking the materials on
	Photoshop, design, and general business development.  They were outside their normal comfort zone.</p>
	<p>When I teach students to code, I realized a long time ago that in reality, all I was really doing was teaching them a new way to express themselves.  So in this way, coders
	overlap with traditional writers.  You can learn to write well, but you write about what interests you.</p>
